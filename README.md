# ![The GrogBot App](public/grog_bot_small.png) (API)
### About the GrogBot
The GrogBot App is a drink application that lets visitors choose a virgin ingredient which once submitted offers a list of drinks. The drinks show ingredients, instructions and type of glass. As the app is connected to a local Swedish liquor provider through an API you can also view a list of the liquors you can purchase in your local store, all Swedish brands of course.

### What would you need
This application has two repositories; the API (this one) and the client([here](https://github.com/kfrostare-Grogbot/team_2_grog_bot_client)). You will need to fork them both to get this App going.
